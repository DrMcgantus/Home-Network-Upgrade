# Home-Network-Upgrade
What I did to upgrade Home Network

## Overview
In this project, I document the steps taken to upgrade my home network, including equipment, configurations, and optimizations.

## Step 1
I used this time to set and plan for the upgrade. I know the previous ISP ran a cable through the attic and down the wall to the specific location the previous owner specified. It is in an unconventional location and I will now be moving everthing to a utility closet in the middle of the home. 

I used this time to set and plan for the upgrade. I know the previous ISP ran a cable through the attic and down the wall to the specific location the previous owner specified. It is in an unconventional location and I will now be moving everything to a utility closet in the middle of the home.

The equipment I will be using is the ARRIS SURFboard SB6190 Cabel Modem and the Protectli Vault FW4B and plenty of Cat5. One of the few reasons I chose the Vault is primarily due to price against other name brand companies and the ease of access to configure what choice of Operating System I want it to have. The ARRIS I already had but wanted to add on some sort of firewall to my system.

Once everything was disconnected, I preceded to remove the Coax cable from the initial wall and into the attic and to the closet it needed to be moved to. Once into the room I had previously set a surge protected outlet at the top with a shelf that will hold everything together. After some wire management and setting the equipment together with wireless keyboard and HDMI the configuration screen started up.  

Finally after configuring access to Admin on the router and tweaking permissions for the Vault devices were connected and am testing for speeds
